            <p>My name is Jorge Morales. I am currently in the process of a career change. I was employed in the field of
                education for about 10 years. I thought I wanted to be a teacher but when I eventually moved up to a
                Substitute Teacher, I realized it wasn't for me and I was unhappy. So, I decided I needed to make a change
                and I have always been fascinated with computers and tech so I decided to give coding a shot! Some of my
                hobbies include sports, video games, reading and now coding.</p>
